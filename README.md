<h2>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm <a href="https://rishit-knowhow.netlify.app/">Rishit</a></h2>

<p>I mess around with data, AI, and ideas that sound cool (in my head atleast).</p>

<p> Trying best to sticking to just snoozing alarms, not ideas.<br>

<h2>A Few Quick Things</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Into machine learning, agentic AI, and stuff that uses graphs in useful ways.</li>
  <li> Currently addicted to RAG and MCP.</li>
  <li> Have crashed (and occasionally won) a few (3) hackathons.</li>
  <li> Teaching Assistant for Social Computing (essentially NLP and Graph Theory slapped together)- there I just pretend I know what Iâ€™m talking about.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p><em>GO - simply because its the powerhouse of the infrastructure behind AI systems - APIs, ML Data Pipelines, CI/CD tools like docker, terraform, etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Deep Reinforcement Learning - its the future.</em></p>
