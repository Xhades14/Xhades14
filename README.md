<h2>Hey 👋, I'm <a href="https://rishit-knowhow.netlify.app/">Rishit</a></h2>

<p>I mess around with data, AI and ideas that sound cool (in my head atleast)</p>

<h2>A Few Quick Things</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Into ML, Agentic AI and stuff that use graphs in useful ways, aka KG.</li>
  <li> Finding joy in building personalized & autonomous AI agents using RAG and MCP.</li>
  <li> Have crashed (and occasionally won) a few hackathons- 3 if we are counting.</li>
  <li> Teaching Assistant for Social Computing Course (essentially its NLP and Graph Theory slapped together)- where I just pretend to know what I’m talking about.</li>
  <li> Upcoming Intern at Nokia R&D, Ex- Product and AI at Angel One (Fintech $2.2B+), ML Research at Deakin University.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p><b>GO</b> - <em>simply because its the powerhouse of the infrastructure behind AI systems - APIs, ML & Data Pipelines, CI/CD tools like docker, terraform, etc.</em></p>
<p><b>RL</b> - <em>it's the future. (update: or maybe not- ES (Evolution strategies) by Cognizant AI Labs suggest otherwise)</em></p>
