<h2>Hey 👋, I'm <a href="https://rishit-knowhow.netlify.app/">Rishit</a></h2>

<p>I mess around with data, AI, and ideas that sound slightly unrealistic until they work. Currently studying Computer Science, building things that don’t always have instructions, and finding weirdly fun problems to obsess over.</p>

<p>🥱 Snoozes alarms, not ideas.<br>
🏗️ Builds before overthinking.<br>
🧠 Occasionally does research just to prove a hunch.<br>
💬 Open to collab, chaos, and coffee.</p>

<h2>⚡️ A Few Quick Things</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🔍 I like figuring out how things connect — data, people, systems.</li>
  <li>🛠️ Sometimes I make tools. Sometimes I just duct tape good ones together.</li>
  <li>🎯 Into machine learning, agentic AI, and stuff that uses graphs in weirdly useful ways.</li>
  <li>🏆 Have crashed (and occasionally won) a few hackathons.</li>
  <li>🎤 Teaching Assistant for Social Computing and pretend I know what I’m talking about.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧪 Now Playing With</h2>

<p><em>Always low-key building. Sometimes high-key shipping.</em></p>
