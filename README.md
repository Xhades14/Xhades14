<h2>Hey 👋, I'm <a href="https://rishit-knowhow.netlify.app/">Rishit</a></h2>

<p>I mess around with data, AI, and ideas that sound cool (in my head atleast). Currently studying Computer Science, building things that don’t always have instructions, and finding weirdly fun problems to obsess over.</p>

<p>🥱 Trying best to sticking to just snoozing alarms, not ideas.<br>
💬 Open to collab, chaos and coffee.</p>

<h2>⚡️ A Few Quick Things</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🎯 Into machine learning, agentic AI, and stuff that uses graphs in useful ways.</li>
  <li>🏗️ I overthink my prompts- do you really think AI is not judging us?</li>
  <li>🏆 Have crashed (and occasionally won) a few (3) hackathons.</li>
  <li>🎤 Teaching Assistant for Social Computing (essentially NLP and Graph Theory slapped together)- I pretend I know what I’m talking about.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧪 Now Playing With</h2>

<p><em>Always low-key building. Sometimes high-key shipping.</em></p>
