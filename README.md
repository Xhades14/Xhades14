<h2>A Few Quick Things</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Into Machine Learning, Agentic AI and stuff that uses graphs in useful ways, aka your knowledge graphs.</li>
  <li> Currently addicted to integrating RAG and MCP into systems for building personalized and autonomous AI agents.</li>
  <li> Have crashed (and occasionally won) a few hackathons- 3 if we are counting.</li>
  <li> Teaching Assistant for Social Computing Course (essentially NLP and Graph Theory slapped together)- where I just pretend to know what I’m talking about.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>

<p><b>GO</b> - <em>simply because its the powerhouse of the infrastructure behind AI systems - APIs, ML & Data Pipelines, CI/CD tools like docker, terraform, etc.</em></p>
<p><b>RL</b> - <em>it's the future (update: or maybe not- ES (Evolution strategies) by Cognizant AI Labs).</em></p>
